Sindane says his mother’s writing about situations of others and of herself inspired him to be able to write about his feelings and others.

He fell in love with the film industry during the earliest stages of his life in primary school and coordinated several shows in his fourth grade. He stated that he was motivated by old stories including Ubambo Lwami (1989) by Percy Langa and many others. His power lies in his courage to express his thoughts and feelings. Additionally, his flexibility in writing and directing.\", \"He <a href='http://www.trialbymedia.tv/' target=”_blank”>won 5 major awards over 14 nominations</a>. These include Best Artistic Bravery award at the Durban International Film Festival (DIFF) for Artistic Bravery Awards, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Visual effects at the African Movie Academy Award (AMMA). As a young emerging filmmaker, being nominated over 14 times supports his inordinate creativity and dedication towards the film industry. He wrote and directed all the films amongst those he’s received awards for.  This shows Vusi’Africa’s dedication to his craft and his talent.  According to him, achieving this much in the film industry demonstrates that the society appreciates his work and not all young filmmakers would be this phenomenal.\", \"Sindane says the writing, directing, and editing compliments each other as it is a universal thing and it is most likely that directors would edit their own films regardless of them taking credit or not, due to the underlaying fact that each film already has an assigned editor. “I’ve edited all three of my films”, Sindane highlighted regarding his flexibility towards the filmmaking process in the film industry. “I’ve been blessed with the work that I’ve been doing, it’s been getting to the right eyes, and it’s been receiving the right attention”, said Sindane.\", \"“The gap between black and white filmmakers will always be an issue of contention, high contention for that matter, and the reason that this will be an issue of high contention is because of the historic reason that have in the past separated black filmmakers and white filmmakers.” Sindane further stated that it is an obvious fact that white filmmakers were in a better position, they were better privileged than black filmmakers, because they had better subsidy schemes and black filmmakers did not. “Which means that historically, if we are to focus, the future of black filmmakers and white filmmakers - white filmmakers are better positioned financially because of their historic advantage to position themselves, because of the financial resources that they have”, Sindane stressed when asked about the gap that apartheid  opened between black and white filmmakers in the film industry.\", \"“We need to start moving away from a dependency of public funding, we need to find a way to carve out a path towards private financing for our films”, Sindane indicated that such is critical to consider as a reliable route that can meet the public sector halfway in terms of consistently funding emerging voices. Sindane heightened that it is very critical that in the film production and in the creation, to consider how filmmakers move towards the ownership of the resources of production, so that a different position in the film value chain can shift to a different dimension.\", \"Sindane is fully aware of the historical impact on African filmmakers, which limits potential content creators to showcase their amazing creativity. “The imbalance of the industry gives African filmmakers a good donkey, cart with no harness”, says Vusi’Africa. The only way to redirect this wave is to be financially independent and establish private funding which shall bring in underprivileged black filmmakers into the field and close up the historical gap. “Government is overloaded and cannot fund enough”, said Vusi’Africa.\", \"As an independent filmmaker Vusi’Africa believes in the constant creation of beautiful work that travels, that speaks to mass audiences, and that reach borders globally. He says students in film school have already won half the battle and the rest of it will begin after school in the beginning of their career path. The black society rarely have access to film schools and such opportunities should not be taken for granted. He further stated that the black societies should be proactive in creating the industry and a beautiful catalogue that can occupy the position aimed at the industry.\", \"He encourages all students studying towards film in different film schools to realise the potential and voice they have in changing Africa through films. As he is actively involved with the community and changing perspectives of black society, the film industry has that power to change the world.\"],\n  profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/VusiProfile.jpeg\"),\n  bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/GazaBanner.png\"),\n  carouselImages: [require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/5.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/2.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/3.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/4.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/VusiAfrica/1.png\")]\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  writers: \"Countries Machate, Happy Khumalo, Pheeha Tjale, & Mmapowana Masete\",\n  name: \"Kizito Samuel Saviour\",\n  trailerName: \"Kizito Samuel Saviour\",\n  professionTitle: \"filmmaker\",\n  bannerSubTitle: \"Shame Of Puberty\",\n  youtubeLink: \"https://youtu.be/NlifSYYJ1i4\",\n  mainTitle: \"Kizito Samuel Saviour - I’m the kind of filmmaker who doesn’t want to repeat or recycle any signatures or symbols in the films I do because I do not want to be predicted by someone else who has been following my works.\",\n  paragraphs: [\"<audio autoplay> <source src=\\\"./KIZITOFINALPODCAST.mp3\\\" type='audio/mpeg'> Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>\", \"Kizito Samuel Saviour has worked in several fields in the film production including producing, Script writing, directing, cinematography and film editing, for films including <a href='https://youtu.be/ZdEQs9YYklg' target=”_blank”> NKWANZI’S SLIP (2023)</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/2hUOhczfkcM' target=”_blank”>MANIA (2022)</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/jBqwh84ANSE' target=”_blank”>Your Turn (2022)</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/LCDjcxqFXn4' target=”_blank”>Catch Out (2021)</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/smfnYV_nAJo' target=”_blank”>KEMI (2020)</a> and others, that picked up over 130 international nominations and over 30 international awards from film festivals and awarding platforms from all over the world.\", \"Kizito Samuel Saviour born as Kizito Samuel, is a Ugandan multi-award-winning filmmaker who majors in Producing, Script Writing and Directing. In late 2013 he joined Sky Limit Entertainment as an actor in Uganda where he was inspired to pursue screenwriting that sparked off his filmmaking journey. He is a Film & Video Production Tutor at ESOM School of Music in Uganda, a Film & Television Studies Mentor at the University of Limpopo in South Africa, and a mentor to several upcoming filmmakers and actors in both countries, and Africa at large.\", \"Kizito believes in a distinct vision of his films, hence he developed the courage to generalise in other fields of film production. Kizito’s influence led him to generalise in various fields because of the outcome of the work from his crew. It didn’t always meet his expectations. “I only learned editing and cinematography because I was tired of hiring people who get lazy with work and fail to bring out my vision the way I want it, so now I can hire a cinematographer or editor but if they mess up, I can comfortably step in and achieve that shot or that edit the way I want it,” he emphasised.\", \"This well-known Ugandan Filmmaker also actively participates in the development of African beginner filmmakers. He emphasised that Africa does not have enough studios to promote the film industry. “I would like to see more Film and TV Training institutions in the country that are working towards the goal of producing more trained human resource to work in the industry. I would like to see more cinemas being established in the country in various regions that can hardly access the currently existing cinemas. I’m looking forward to seeing establishments of standard film studios in Uganda for I believe that will add more value to the industry as well as creating more employment”, Kizito elaborated.\", \"He opened a <a href='https://samuelsaviour.wordpress.com/' target=”_blank”>Ugandan film themed blogsite </a>.  The blog is commonly known as a source for Ugandan cinema updates, and it is through this blog that he attained a role of “film critic“ in the film industry. He joined The Ghetto Film Project, an organisation that mentors underprivileged kids into film, and he acquired more filmmaking knowledge and mentorship.\", \"Kizito has directed 10 feature films and five short films. Although this has been a tremendous experience for Kizito, he emphasised that his journey had ample obstacles due to lack of funding. “As a director when the project has less funding I’m limited because that means there will be less resources to tell the story”.  He says working with less resources affected him, however it gave room for creativity. The most critical challenges he faced had to do with budget for the projects, and due to the limited skills of his producers, cast and crew, the projects would be much more challenging than anticipated.\", \"Kizito states that every film he produced has unique signatures and symbols, and repetition is not in his bucket list. “I’m the kind of filmmaker who doesn’t want to repeat or recycle any signatures or symbols in the films I do because I don’t want to be predicted by someone else who has been following my works,” he highlights.  Kizito is versatile in themes and genres, “I’ve served greatly with family dramas and dark African stories that work with family conflict, love, incest, good meets evil, poverty, haves and have nots, betrayal, togetherness, no bad deed goes unpunished, and for every story I make.”\", \"He considers significant symbols for each story world, and the films  he directs have an intense focus on characters, expressions, and their emotions, considering the bond creation and connection between the viewers and characters on screen. He believes that racking focus, tracking their faces to highlight their feelings as being projected to viewers on the characters personalities can sink into the viewers mind so they can empathise with the characters.\", \"He believes the key to mastery is to always be a student, learn from every moment, and find your purpose in life. Your purpose should be to love and share as well as serve the world, and you should find ways to share and serve it. Violence is never a solution to problems. Kizito further believes that Africa could be a leading continent in the film industry, only if the government and other involved entities put a hand in terms of funding and providing necessary resources to beginners and experienced filmmakers in the continent.\", \"Kizito would like to be remembered in Africa as a filmmaker who told inspirational stories that impacted positively on people’s lives, because of the truth and authenticity he portrayed in every story he produced. He urges filmmakers not to settle for less when it comes to storytelling regardless of the limited resources they possess. His greatest wish is to collaborate and create a bond amongst other African storytellers while enhancing their abilities to do better.\"],\n  profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/KizitoProfilePic.png\"),\n  bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/banner.png\"),\n  carouselImages: [require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/1.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/2.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/3.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/4.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/5.png\"), require(\"./RuImages/KizitoBlogImages/6.png\")]\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  writers: \"Dan\",\n  name: \"Reabetswe Rea Moeti\",\n  trailerName: \"Mma Moeketsi\",\n  professionTitle: \"filmmaker\",\n  bannerSubTitle: \"Based on a true event, the Marikana Massacre.\",\n  youtubeLink: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro23zJUzwls\",\n  mainTitle: \"Reabetswe Rea Moeti - I want to exercise my voice and leave a mark\",\n  paragraphs: [\"The ambitious African writer was motivated to tell her story to the world when she first met Malume Sammy Fever from Mabopane,Pretoria who helped her realize her vision.

This film emanates from what happened in Marikana but it also speaks to the story of a real person called Mma Moeketsi. Rea says the story is close to her heart because Mma Moeketsi has worked for her family as a domestic worker for about 14 years now. “Her story was important to me because her son was at the mines when the strike happened so I wanted to tell her story to the world from her perspective”, she alluded.\", \"Rea has ventured into many other film related activities including writing and directing TV shows which has helped to sharpen her skills and develop an instinct for directing. There are other films that are part of Moeti’s craft like The Virgin Vegan. When we asked which of her films were her favourites, Rea mentioned that The Virgin Vegan and Mma Moeketsi have always been her best films thus far. The renounced filmmaker says she is getting better at storytelling, communicating her point through visuals, sound design and good editing.\", \"In any case, the struggle continues for Moeti as she is developing two films with MNET movies at the moment. “I am looking forward to finishing the writing process so that we can film those two features”, she confirmed.

The closest thing next to Animation was Graphic Design, but it focussed on illustrations. On closer inspection, I knew I did not want to spend the rest of my life drawing, so Animation became the next thing I discovered.  After I graduated with a Master’s degree in Animation in London, I thought “great I’ve got a degree, I can now work in the industry”. That was not the case, for I ended up working in a supermarket for seven long years. Those times were frustrating and depressing.

My first produced film “The Peculiar life of a spider (2015)” got me my first AMMA nomination. It also gave me the confidence to make more short films, as the following year, I produced “Imagine (2016)” and “Black Barbie (2016)”. We screened them all over the world. “Black Barbie (2016)” gave me my first directorial award at the Black Star International Film Festival (BSIFS).\", \"Given the fact that it has not been easy for women Animators in the past, how did you climb to the top regardless of the challenges?\", \"I have a supportive close circle of creatives that have pushed me and supported me in my career.

I think that some of the best films created are from our personal experiences. During my degree, my thesis was about how animation can be therapeutic, so making this film was like going to therapy.

He fell in love with the film industry during the earliest stages of his life in primary school and coordinated several shows in his fourth grade. He stated that he was motivated by old stories including Ubambo Lwami (1989) by Percy Langa and many others. His power lies in his courage to express his thoughts and feelings. Additionally, his flexibility in writing and directing.\",\n    \"He <a href='http://www.trialbymedia.tv/' target=”_blank”>won 5 major awards over 14 nominations</a>. These include Best Artistic Bravery award at the Durban International Film Festival (DIFF) for Artistic Bravery Awards, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Visual effects at the African Movie Academy Award (AMMA). As a young emerging filmmaker, being nominated over 14 times supports his inordinate creativity and dedication towards the film industry. He wrote and directed all the films amongst those he’s received awards for.  This shows Vusi’Africa’s dedication to his craft and his talent.  According to him, achieving this much in the film industry demonstrates that the society appreciates his work and not all young filmmakers would be this phenomenal.\",\n    \"Sindane says the writing, directing, and editing compliments each other as it is a universal thing and it is most likely that directors would edit their own films regardless of them taking credit or not, due to the underlaying fact that each film already has an assigned editor. “I’ve edited all three of my films”, Sindane highlighted regarding his flexibility towards the filmmaking process in the film industry. “I’ve been blessed with the work that I’ve been doing, it’s been getting to the right eyes, and it’s been receiving the right attention”, said Sindane.\",\n    \"“The gap between black and white filmmakers will always be an issue of contention, high contention for that matter, and the reason that this will be an issue of high contention is because of the historic reason that have in the past separated black filmmakers and white filmmakers.” Sindane further stated that it is an obvious fact that white filmmakers were in a better position, they were better privileged than black filmmakers, because they had better subsidy schemes and black filmmakers did not. “Which means that historically, if we are to focus, the future of black filmmakers and white filmmakers - white filmmakers are better positioned financially because of their historic advantage to position themselves, because of the financial resources that they have”, Sindane stressed when asked about the gap that apartheid  opened between black and white filmmakers in the film industry.\",\n    \"“We need to start moving away from a dependency of public funding, we need to find a way to carve out a path towards private financing for our films”, Sindane indicated that such is critical to consider as a reliable route that can meet the public sector halfway in terms of consistently funding emerging voices. Sindane heightened that it is very critical that in the film production and in the creation, to consider how filmmakers move towards the ownership of the resources of production, so that a different position in the film value chain can shift to a different dimension.\",\n   \"Sindane is fully aware of the historical impact on African filmmakers, which limits potential content creators to showcase their amazing creativity. “The imbalance of the industry gives African filmmakers a good donkey, cart with no harness”, says Vusi’Africa. The only way to redirect this wave is to be financially independent and establish private funding which shall bring in underprivileged black filmmakers into the field and close up the historical gap. “Government is overloaded and cannot fund enough”, said Vusi’Africa.\",\n   \"As an independent filmmaker Vusi’Africa believes in the constant creation of beautiful work that travels, that speaks to mass audiences, and that reach borders globally. He says students in film school have already won half the battle and the rest of it will begin after school in the beginning of their career path. The black society rarely have access to film schools and such opportunities should not be taken for granted. He further stated that the black societies should be proactive in creating the industry and a beautiful catalogue that can occupy the position aimed at the industry.\",\n   \"He encourages all students studying towards film in different film schools to realise the potential and voice they have in changing Africa through films.

He is a Film & Video Production Tutor at ESOM School of Music in Uganda, a Film & Television Studies Mentor at the University of Limpopo in South Africa, and a mentor to several upcoming filmmakers and actors in both countries, and Africa at large.\",\n         \"Kizito believes in a distinct vision of his films, hence he developed the courage to generalise in other fields of film production. Kizito’s influence led him to generalise in various fields because of the outcome of the work from his crew. It didn’t always meet his expectations. “I only learned editing and cinematography because I was tired of hiring people who get lazy with work and fail to bring out my vision the way I want it, so now I can hire a cinematographer or editor but if they mess up, I can comfortably step in and achieve that shot or that edit the way I want it,” he emphasised.\",\n          \"This well-known Ugandan Filmmaker also actively participates in the development of African beginner filmmakers. He emphasised that Africa does not have enough studios to promote the film industry. “I would like to see more Film and TV Training institutions in the country that are working towards the goal of producing more trained human resource to work in the industry. I would like to see more cinemas being established in the country in various regions that can hardly access the currently existing cinemas. I’m looking forward to seeing establishments of standard film studios in Uganda for I believe that will add more value to the industry as well as creating more employment”, Kizito elaborated.\",\n          \"He opened a <a href='https://samuelsaviour.wordpress.com/' target=”_blank”>Ugandan film themed blogsite </a>.  The blog is commonly known as a source for Ugandan cinema updates, and it is through this blog that he attained a role of “film critic“ in the film industry. He joined The Ghetto Film Project, an organisation that mentors underprivileged kids into film, and he acquired more filmmaking knowledge and mentorship.\",\n          \"Kizito has directed 10 feature films and five short films. Although this has been a tremendous experience for Kizito, he emphasised that his journey had ample obstacles due to lack of funding. “As a director when the project has less funding I’m limited because that means there will be less resources to tell the story”.  He says working with less resources affected him, however it gave room for creativity. The most critical challenges he faced had to do with budget for the projects, and due to the limited skills of his producers, cast and crew, the projects would be much more challenging than anticipated.\",\n          \"Kizito states that every film he produced has unique signatures and symbols, and repetition is not in his bucket list. “I’m the kind of filmmaker who doesn’t want to repeat or recycle any signatures or symbols in the films I do because I don’t want to be predicted by someone else who has been following my works,” he highlights.  Kizito is versatile in themes and genres, “I’ve served greatly with family dramas and dark African stories that work with family conflict, love, incest, good meets evil, poverty, haves and have nots, betrayal, togetherness, no bad deed goes unpunished, and for every story I make.”\",\n          \"He considers significant symbols for each story world, and the films  he directs have an intense focus on characters, expressions, and their emotions, considering the bond creation and connection between the viewers and characters on screen. He believes that racking focus, tracking their faces to highlight their feelings as being projected to viewers on the characters personalities can sink into the viewers mind so they can empathise with the characters.\",\n           \"He believes the key to mastery is to always be a student, learn from every moment, and find your purpose in life. Your purpose should be to love and share as well as serve the world, and you should find ways to share and serve it. Violence is never a solution to problems. Kizito further believes that Africa could be a leading continent in the film industry, only if the government and other involved entities put a hand in terms of funding and providing necessary resources to beginners and experienced filmmakers in the continent.\",\n           \"Kizito would like to be remembered in Africa as a filmmaker who told inspirational stories that impacted positively on people’s lives, because of the truth and authenticity he portrayed in every story he produced.

The filmmaker elaborated that even the whole exercise of being a filmmaker came with a lot of effort that had to be put in each and every day.\",\n      \"The renowned filmmaker was behind the production of a documentary called When babies don’t come and a short film, Womb-man and they are both about attempting and failing at getting pregnant. These projects have a special attachment to a real life situation of Molatelo where she tried to fall pregnant in her real life but could not. In any case, the struggle continues for Molatelo as she hopes to do more projects in the future.\",\n      \"She is now working towards becoming an international filmmaker and a driver of a television channel that will broadcast ‘marginalised’ content. Molatelo’s target market is the currently neglected audience where the poor are situated. “I’m moving from being just a content creator to a broadcaster”, she explained. However, Molatelo also has her eyes on skills development programmes that she runs in partnership with other interested parties. She is also working on a certain film that will be released soon and some documentaries whose names she could not reveal yet.\",\n    ],\n    profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/WombManProfile.JPG\"),\n    bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/WombManBanner.JPG\"),\n    carouselImages: [\n      require(\"./RuImages/WombMan2.JPG\"),\n      require(\"./RuImages/WombMan1.JPG\"),\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    id: 6,\n    writer: \"Dan\",\n    name: \"Comfort Arthur\",\n    trailerName: \"Black Barbie\",\n    professionTitle: \"filmmaker\",\n    bannerSubTitle: \"Comfort Arthur\",\n    youtubeLink: \"https://youtu.be/_SxaLHVu5FI\",\n    mainTitle:\n      \"Comfort Arthur - I would like to take my storytelling processes to the next level - to push the boundaries \",\n    paragraphs: [\n      \"Comfort Arthur is a British Born Ghanaian with a Bachelor’s Degree in Graphic Design from Central St Martins and a Master’s Degree in Animation from the Royal College of Arts. In December 2012, she moved to Ghana and now works as a freelance Editor, Illustrator, Graphic Designer, and an Animator. She has worked on several award-winning films in Ghana.\",\n      \"In 2015, her short animation film The peculiar Life of a Spider (2015) garnered a nomination at the Ghana Movie Awards (GMA) and Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAA). She has won several awards for her short animation film Imagine (2016), which won best Animation in 2016. Her latest film Black Barbie (2016) won Best Poetry film at the Real Time festival and Best Animation at Ghana Movie Awards, both in 2016.\",\n      \"What made you decide that you wanted to do animation as a career and which was the first animation project you directed?\",\n      \"I knew as a child I was very creative, but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. The closest thing next to Animation was Graphic Design, but it focussed on illustrations. On closer inspection, I knew I did not want to spend the rest of my life drawing, so Animation became the next thing I discovered.  After I graduated with a Master’s degree in Animation in London, I thought “great I’ve got a degree, I can now work in the industry”. That was not the case, for I ended up working in a supermarket for seven long years. Those times were frustrating and depressing. In 2012, my younger sister saw an advert that a production company in Ghana was looking for a Film Editor.\",\n      \"That’s how I left London and moved to Ghana to become a Film Editor. I learned so much about filmmaking and even how to edit films. In 2015, I wanted to work on my animation projects, so I left and became a freelancer. I started working on my own personal projects. My first produced film “The Peculiar life of a spider (2015)” got me my first AMMA nomination. It also gave me the confidence to make more short films, as the following year, I produced “Imagine (2016)” and “Black Barbie (2016)”. We screened them all over the world. “Black Barbie (2016)” gave me my first directorial award at the Black Star International Film Festival (BSIFS).\",\n      \"Given the fact that it has not been easy for women Animators in the past, how did you climb to the top regardless of the challenges?\",\n      \"I have a supportive close circle of creatives that have pushed me and supported me in my career. Many have been the opposite sex that have championed me and also helped me to thrive in the industry. There are many female animators around the continent producing amazing work, which makes me so happy. With that being said, we still have a long road.  We need to teach both men and women about the power of animation.\",\n      \"The lack of willingness by other animators and digital artists to collaborate sometimes on projects has been a hindrance to engagement on wider projects. As a filmmaker, my biggest challenge has been the inability to raise funding for some of my animation projects.\",\n      \"One of your best films is “Black Barbie”; please tell us what motivated you to do this film and what basic message were you spreading across?\",\n      \"I initially wrote Black Barbie for my younger cousin, who was battling with low self-esteem because of her skin colour. When she confided in me that, she wanted to bleach her skin, like my cousin - many were battling with coming to terms with their skin colour. So I wrote Black Barbie with her in mind, so that she could read and understand that she was not alone and that I too had once hated my skin tone. I think that some of the best films created are from our personal experiences. During my degree, my thesis was about how animation can be therapeutic, so making this film was like going to therapy. I had to go back to my past and memories and feelings, which helped me talk to my cousin and advise her.\",\n      \"Of all the films that you have directed throughout your career; which one is your favourite and why? \",\n      \"I call my favourite project “I’m Living in Ghana Get Me Out of Here 2017”. I wanted to prove that you can make a successful web series on a tight budget, and so I spent 3 months creating this personal experience of my time living in Ghana. I loved making this film as I wanted viewers to relate and understand the complexities of having dual cultures. The web series is on Kweli TV.  You can sign up and watch it here…\",\n      \"https://www.kweli.tv/programs/im-living-in-ghana-get-me-out-of-here/\",\n      \"What advice could you give to young women who aspire to become Film Directors or Animators?\",\n      \"Don’t give up! Being a filmmaker is not glamorous, as many people believe it to be. In the world, getting money to fund films is daunting and frustrating. When I am out of work, I work on my own personal projects. I also use those quiet times to learn new skills. It is important to always learn to pick up new skills. Animation is a new idea to the market in Africa, so it has become a gradual thing for companies that are doing animated commercials. Having another skill is fundamental, I am not only an animator, but I also edit and act when animation jobs dry up.\",\n      \"Are there any film related projects that you are working on or will work on soon?\",\n      \"Given the fact that films are evolving.  I am exploring the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in storytelling. I have been storytelling across several mediums from traditional picture book illustrations to comics and animation. I would like to take my storytelling processes to the next level, to push the boundaries and fuse these areas together to create some unique and engaging work using VR and AR.\",\n    ],\n    profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie1.jpg\"),\n    bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\"),\n    carouselImages: [\n      require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\"),\n      require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie2.jpg\")\n    ],\n  }\n];\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
