In December 2012, she moved to Ghana and now works as a freelance Editor, Illustrator, Graphic Designer, and an Animator.

Her latest film Black Barbie (2016) won Best Poetry film at the Real Time festival and Best Animation at Ghana Movie Awards, both in 2016.\", \"What made you decide that you wanted to do animation as a career and which was the first animation project you directed?\", \"I knew as a child I was very creative, but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. The closest thing next to Animation was Graphic Design, but it focussed on illustrations. On closer inspection, I knew I did not want to spend the rest of my life drawing, so Animation became the next thing I discovered.  After I graduated with a Master’s degree in Animation in London, I thought “great I’ve got a degree, I can now work in the industry”. That was not the case, for I ended up working in a supermarket for seven long years. Those times were frustrating and depressing. In 2012, my younger sister saw an advert that a production company in Ghana was looking for a Film Editor.\", \"That’s how I left London and moved to Ghana to become a Film Editor. I learned so much about filmmaking and even how to edit films. In 2015, I wanted to work on my animation projects, so I left and became a freelancer. I started working on my own personal projects. My first produced film “The Peculiar life of a spider (2015)” got me my first AMMA nomination. It also gave me the confidence to make more short films, as the following year, I produced “Imagine (2016)” and “Black Barbie (2016)”. We screened them all over the world. “Black Barbie (2016)” gave me my first directorial award at the Black Star International Film Festival (BSIFS).\", \"Given the fact that it has not been easy for women Animators in the past, how did you climb to the top regardless of the challenges?\", \"I have a supportive close circle of creatives that have pushed me and supported me in my career. Many have been the opposite sex that have championed me and also helped me to thrive in the industry. There are many female animators around the continent producing amazing work, which makes me so happy. With that being said, we still have a long road.  We need to teach both men and women about the power of animation.\", \"The lack of willingness by other animators and digital artists to collaborate sometimes on projects has been a hindrance to engagement on wider projects. As a filmmaker, my biggest challenge has been the inability to raise funding for some of my animation projects.\", \"One of your best films is “Black Barbie”; please tell us what motivated you to do this film and what basic message were you spreading across?\", \"I initially wrote Black Barbie for my younger cousin, who was battling with low self-esteem because of her skin colour. When she confided in me that, she wanted to bleach her skin, like my cousin - many were battling with coming to terms with their skin colour. So I wrote Black Barbie with her in mind, so that she could read and understand that she was not alone and that I too had once hated my skin tone. I think that some of the best films created are from our personal experiences. During my degree, my thesis was about how animation can be therapeutic, so making this film was like going to therapy. I had to go back to my past and memories and feelings, which helped me talk to my cousin and advise her.\", \"Of all the films that you have directed throughout your career; which one is your favourite and why? \", \"I call my favourite project “I’m Living in Ghana Get Me Out of Here 2017”. I wanted to prove that you can make a successful web series on a tight budget, and so I spent 3 months creating this personal experience of my time living in Ghana. I loved making this film as I wanted viewers to relate and understand the complexities of having dual cultures. The web series is on Kweli TV.  You can sign up and watch it here…\", \"https://www.kweli.tv/programs/im-living-in-ghana-get-me-out-of-here/\", \"What advice could you give to young women who aspire to become Film Directors or Animators?\", \"Don’t give up! Being a filmmaker is not glamorous, as many people believe it to be. In the world, getting money to fund films is daunting and frustrating. When I am out of work, I work on my own personal projects. I also use those quiet times to learn new skills. It is important to always learn to pick up new skills. Animation is a new idea to the market in Africa, so it has become a gradual thing for companies that are doing animated commercials. Having another skill is fundamental, I am not only an animator, but I also edit and act when animation jobs dry up.\", \"Are there any film related projects that you are working on or will work on soon?\", \"Given the fact that films are evolving.  I am exploring the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in storytelling. I have been storytelling across several mediums from traditional picture book illustrations to comics and animation. I would like to take my storytelling processes to the next level, to push the boundaries and fuse these areas together to create some unique and engaging work using VR and AR.\"],\n  profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie1.jpg\"),\n  bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\"),\n  carouselImages: [require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie2.jpg\"), require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie3.jpg\"), require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\")]\n}];","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/vusi/Desktop/Projects/RudzaniFilm/src/views/Components/Rudzani/blogPostData.js"],"names":["blogPostData","id","name","trailerName","professionTitle","bannerSubTitle","youtubeLink","mainTitle","paragraphs","profileImage","require","bannerImage","carouselImages"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAO,IAAMA,YAAY,GAAG,CAC1B;AACEC,EAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,EAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,qBAFR;AAGEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,cAHf;AAIEC,EAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,WAJnB;AAKEC,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,+CALlB;AAMEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,6CANf;AAOEC,EAAAA,SAAS,EACP,oEARJ;AASEC,EAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,CACV,sdADU,EAEV,mTAFU,EAGV,uhBAHU,EAIV,6gBAJU,EAKV,8hBALU,EAMV,gVANU,CATd;AAiBEC,EAAAA,YAAY,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,2BAAD,CAjBvB;AAkBEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAED,OAAO,CAAC,yBAAD,CAlBtB;AAmBEE,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,CACdF,OAAO,CAAC,2BAAD,CADO,EAEdA,OAAO,CAAC,0BAAD,CAFO;AAnBlB,CAD0B,EAyB1B;AACET,EAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,EAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,aAFR;AAGEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,SAHf;AAIEC,EAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,WAJnB;AAKEC,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,+BALlB;AAMEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,8BANf;AAOEC,EAAAA,SAAS,EAAE,2DAPb;AAQEC,EAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,CACV,0dADU,EAEV,ysBAFU,EAGV,ymBAHU,EAIV,mVAJU,EAKV,8aALU,CARd;AAeEC,EAAAA,YAAY,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,kCAAD,CAfvB;AAgBEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAED,OAAO,CAAC,8BAAD,CAhBtB;AAiBEE,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,CACdF,OAAO,CAAC,gCAAD,CADO,EAEdA,OAAO,CAAC,gCAAD,CAFO;AAjBlB,CAzB0B,EA+C1B;AACET,EAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,EAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,mBAFR;AAGEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,UAHf;AAIEC,EAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,WAJnB;AAKEC,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,uBALlB;AAMEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,8BANf;AAOEC,EAAAA,SAAS,EACP,0FARJ;AASEC,EAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,CACV,6WADU,EAEV,2fAFU,EAGV,uaAHU,EAIV,gbAJU,EAKV,0jBALU,CATd;AAgBEC,EAAAA,YAAY,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,+BAAD,CAhBvB;AAiBEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAED,OAAO,CAAC,8BAAD,CAjBtB;AAkBEE,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,CACdF,OAAO,CAAC,yBAAD,CADO,EAEdA,OAAO,CAAC,yBAAD,CAFO;AAlBlB,CA/C0B,EAsE1B;AACET,EAAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CADN;AAEEC,EAAAA,IAAI,EAAE,gBAFR;AAGEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,cAHf;AAIEC,EAAAA,eAAe,EAAE,WAJnB;AAKEC,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,gBALlB;AAMEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAE,8BANf;AAOEC,EAAAA,SAAS,EACP,6GARJ;AASEC,EAAAA,UAAU,EAAE,CACV,mWADU,EAEV,2ZAFU,EAGV,0HAHU,EAIV,yqBAJU,EAKV,soBALU,EAMV,sIANU,EAOV,kaAPU,EAQV,2QARU,EASV,+IATU,EAUV,ysBAVU,EAWV,uGAXU,EAYV,oaAZU,EAaV,sEAbU,EAcV,6FAdU,EAeV,yjBAfU,EAgBV,mFAhBU,EAiBV,0aAjBU,CATd;AA4BEC,EAAAA,YAAY,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,6BAAD,CA5BvB;AA6BEC,EAAAA,WAAW,EAAED,OAAO,CAAC,4BAAD,CA7BtB;AA8BEE,EAAAA,cAAc,EAAE,CACdF,OAAO,CAAC,6BAAD,CADO,EAEdA,OAAO,CAAC,6BAAD,CAFO,EAGdA,OAAO,CAAC,4BAAD,CAHO;AA9BlB,CAtE0B,CAArB","sourcesContent":["export const blogPostData = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: \"Reabetswe Rea Moeti\",\n    trailerName: \"Mma Moeketsi\",\n    professionTitle: \"filmmaker\",\n    bannerSubTitle: \"Based on a true event, the Marikana Massacre.\",\n    youtubeLink: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro23zJUzwls\",\n    mainTitle:\n      \"Reabetswe Rea Moeti - I want to exercise my voice and leave a mark\",\n    paragraphs: [\n      \"The ambitious African writer was motivated to tell her story to the world when she first met Malume Sammy Fever from Mabopane,Pretoria who helped her realize her vision.

The closest thing next to Animation was Graphic Design, but it focussed on illustrations. On closer inspection, I knew I did not want to spend the rest of my life drawing, so Animation became the next thing I discovered.  After I graduated with a Master’s degree in Animation in London, I thought “great I’ve got a degree, I can now work in the industry”. That was not the case, for I ended up working in a supermarket for seven long years. Those times were frustrating and depressing. In 2012, my younger sister saw an advert that a production company in Ghana was looking for a Film Editor.\",\n      \"That’s how I left London and moved to Ghana to become a Film Editor. I learned so much about filmmaking and even how to edit films. In 2015, I wanted to work on my animation projects, so I left and became a freelancer. I started working on my own personal projects. My first produced film “The Peculiar life of a spider (2015)” got me my first AMMA nomination. It also gave me the confidence to make more short films, as the following year, I produced “Imagine (2016)” and “Black Barbie (2016)”. We screened them all over the world. “Black Barbie (2016)” gave me my first directorial award at the Black Star International Film Festival (BSIFS).\",\n      \"Given the fact that it has not been easy for women Animators in the past, how did you climb to the top regardless of the challenges?\",\n      \"I have a supportive close circle of creatives that have pushed me and supported me in my career. Many have been the opposite sex that have championed me and also helped me to thrive in the industry. There are many female animators around the continent producing amazing work, which makes me so happy. With that being said, we still have a long road.  We need to teach both men and women about the power of animation.\",\n      \"The lack of willingness by other animators and digital artists to collaborate sometimes on projects has been a hindrance to engagement on wider projects. As a filmmaker, my biggest challenge has been the inability to raise funding for some of my animation projects.\",\n      \"One of your best films is “Black Barbie”; please tell us what motivated you to do this film and what basic message were you spreading across?\",\n      \"I initially wrote Black Barbie for my younger cousin, who was battling with low self-esteem because of her skin colour. When she confided in me that, she wanted to bleach her skin, like my cousin - many were battling with coming to terms with their skin colour. So I wrote Black Barbie with her in mind, so that she could read and understand that she was not alone and that I too had once hated my skin tone. I think that some of the best films created are from our personal experiences. During my degree, my thesis was about how animation can be therapeutic, so making this film was like going to therapy. I had to go back to my past and memories and feelings, which helped me talk to my cousin and advise her.\",\n      \"Of all the films that you have directed throughout your career; which one is your favourite and why? \",\n      \"I call my favourite project “I’m Living in Ghana Get Me Out of Here 2017”. I wanted to prove that you can make a successful web series on a tight budget, and so I spent 3 months creating this personal experience of my time living in Ghana. I loved making this film as I wanted viewers to relate and understand the complexities of having dual cultures. The web series is on Kweli TV.  You can sign up and watch it here…\",\n      \"https://www.kweli.tv/programs/im-living-in-ghana-get-me-out-of-here/\",\n      \"What advice could you give to young women who aspire to become Film Directors or Animators?\",\n      \"Don’t give up! Being a filmmaker is not glamorous, as many people believe it to be. In the world, getting money to fund films is daunting and frustrating. When I am out of work, I work on my own personal projects. I also use those quiet times to learn new skills. It is important to always learn to pick up new skills. Animation is a new idea to the market in Africa, so it has become a gradual thing for companies that are doing animated commercials. Having another skill is fundamental, I am not only an animator, but I also edit and act when animation jobs dry up.\",\n      \"Are there any film related projects that you are working on or will work on soon?\",\n      \"Given the fact that films are evolving.  I am exploring the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in storytelling. I have been storytelling across several mediums from traditional picture book illustrations to comics and animation. I would like to take my storytelling processes to the next level, to push the boundaries and fuse these areas together to create some unique and engaging work using VR and AR.\",\n    ],\n    profileImage: require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie1.jpg\"),\n    bannerImage: require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\"),\n    carouselImages: [\n      require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie2.jpg\"),\n      require(\"./RuImages/BlackBarbie3.jpg\"),\n      require(\"./RuImages/blackbarbie.jpg\")\n    ],\n  }\n];\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
